          <summary><h2>1. Constitutional Provisions (Articles)</h2></summary>
          <div style="padding:10px">
            <p>Below are concise explanations of key articles related to budget and finance — each in 4–5 lines for quick memorization.</p>

            <h3>Article 110 — Money Bill</h3>
            <p>A Money Bill concerns only taxation, borrowing, payments from the Consolidated Fund, or receipts. It can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha on the President's recommendation. The Speaker certifies a Money Bill and the Rajya Sabha can only recommend changes; it must return to Lok Sabha within 14 days. The Speaker's certificate on Money Bill is final and cannot be questioned in court.</p>

            <h3>Article 111 — Assent to Bills</h3>
            <p>After both Houses pass a bill, it is presented to the President who may give assent, withhold assent, or return it (except Money Bills). When returned (non-Money Bill), Parliament may reconsider and pass it again; President may still withhold assent. For Money Bills, President must give assent and cannot return the bill.</p>

            <h3>Article 112 — Annual Financial Statement</h3>
            <p>The Annual Financial Statement is the Union Budget — a detailed estimate of receipts and expenditure for the coming financial year. It is divided into Revenue and Capital budgets and presented in Parliament annually by the Finance Minister. It forms the basis for demands for grants and appropriation.</p>

            <h3>Article 113 — Demands for Grants</h3>
            <p>Demands for Grants are the detailed estimates of expenditure submitted to Lok Sabha department-wise. Only Lok Sabha has the power to vote and pass these demands; Rajya Sabha may discuss but cannot vote. Voting on demands is essential before money is withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund for specific heads.</p>

            <h3>Article 114 — Appropriation Bill</h3>
            <p>The Appropriation Bill authorizes the government to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund for the purposes and amounts approved by Parliament. It follows the passing of Demands for Grants; no money can be withdrawn without an Appropriation Act. It usually accompanies the Finance Bill during budget closure.</p>

            <h3>Article 115 — Supplementary, Additional and Excess Grants</h3>
            <p>If expenditures exceed the sanctioned budget, or new services arise, the government seeks Supplementary, Additional or Excess Grants. Supplementary Grants are for additional requirements; Additional Grants are for new services; Excess Grants are for expenditures unauthorized earlier and require retrospective approval.</p>

            <h3>Article 116 — Vote on Account, Vote of Credit, Exceptional Grants</h3>
            <p>Vote on Account allows temporary withdrawal of funds pending full budget approval (commonly used during elections). Vote of Credit is for unforeseen urgent expenditure (e.g., war), and Exceptional Grants refer to special non-recurring needs; Parliament authorizes these as required to maintain government functioning.</p>

            <h3>Article 117 — Special Provisions for Financial Bills</h3>
            <p>Financial Bills include both money and non-money provisions and need President's recommendation before introduction. Unlike pure Money Bills, Rajya Sabha has greater participation and may amend financial bills, though Money Bill rules do not apply. The article ensures special procedures for mixed-content bills.</p>

            <h3>Article 148 — Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG)</h3>
            <p>CAG audits Union and State government accounts, public sector undertakings, and reports on public finances. Appointed by the President, CAG holds office for six years or until age 65 and functions independently to ensure fiscal accountability. CAG's audit reports are vital for legislative scrutiny and appear before Parliament and state legislatures.</p>

            <h3>Articles 149–151 — Duties & Reports of CAG</h3>
            <p>These articles define CAG's powers (audit scope, audit of companies), prescribe the form and maintenance of government accounts, and require that CAG's reports be submitted to the President/Governor and laid before legislatures. They institutionalize the audit process and reporting cycle.</p>

            <h3>Article 265 — Taxes</h3>
            <p>"No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law." This fundamental limit ensures taxation requires legislative backing, protecting citizens from arbitrary taxation and ensuring parliamentary control over tax laws.</p>

            <h3>Article 266 — Consolidated Fund, Contingency Fund, and Public Account</h3>
            <p>Article 266 organizes the three principal government accounts: Consolidated Fund (all revenues and public expenditure), Contingency Fund (for urgent unexpected expenses at President's disposal), and Public Account (trust and deposit liabilities held by government). Withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund require parliamentary approval.</p>

            <h3>Article 267 — Contingency Fund of India</h3>
            <p>Contingency Fund is established and kept at the President's disposal to meet unforeseen or urgent expenditures. Advances from this fund are later regularized by Parliament through Appropriation Bills. It ensures immediate availability of funds in emergencies.</p>

            <h3>Article 280 — Finance Commission</h3>
            <p>Constituted by the President every five years, the Finance Commission recommends distribution of net proceeds of taxes between Union and States, and grants-in-aid to states. It aims to secure fiscal federalism and adjust vertical and horizontal imbalances in resource allocation.</p>

            <h3>Article 293 — Borrowing by States</h3>
            <p>States can borrow within India, but if they have outstanding loans from the Union, further borrowing may need the Union's consent. The article regulates state-level borrowing to maintain macro-fiscal stability and coordination between Union and states.</p>

            <h3>Article 360 — Financial Emergency</h3>
            <p>Allows the President to proclaim a Financial Emergency if India's financial stability is threatened. During such a proclamation, the Centre can direct states to observe certain financial measures and reduce salaries of Govt. officials; it enhances Union control over finances to restore stability.</p>

          <div style="padding:10px">
            <h4>Revenue Budget</h4>
            <p>Revenue Receipts include tax revenue (income tax, GST, customs) and non-tax revenue (dividends, fees, interest). Revenue Expenditure covers routine expenses: subsidies, salaries, interest payments and pensions — these do not create assets but are recurring in nature.</p>

            <h4>Capital Budget</h4>
            <p>Capital Receipts are borrowings, recoveries of loans, and other capital receipts. Capital Expenditure is on long-term assets such as infrastructure, defence capital works and investments that create assets or reduce liabilities.</p>
          </div>

          <summary><h2>4. Classification of Budgets & Deficits</h2></summary>
          <div style="padding:10px">
            <p><strong>Balanced Budget:</strong> Receipts = Expenditure. <strong>Surplus Budget:</strong> Receipts &gt; Expenditure. <strong>Deficit Budget:</strong> Expenditure &gt; Receipts (most common).</p>
            <p><strong>Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Total expenditure minus total receipts (excluding borrowings). It indicates government’s borrowing requirement. <strong>Revenue Deficit:</strong> Revenue Expenditure minus Revenue Receipts. <strong>Primary Deficit:</strong> Fiscal deficit minus interest payments.</p>
            <p><strong>Effective Revenue Deficit:</strong> Revenue deficit less grants for capital expenditure — shows mismatch in revenue account that affects investment.</p>

          <summary><h2>5. Stages of Budget Making (Detailed)</h2></summary>
          <div style="padding:10px">
            <h4>Preparation (Sept–Jan)</h4>
            <p>Finance Ministry circulates guidelines; ministries submit demand estimates; consultations with RBI, NITI Aayog, CAG inputs; iterative meetings with PM and Cabinet. The Budget Call is issued, setting timelines for estimates.</p>

            <h4>Presentation (1st Feb)</h4>
            <p>Finance Minister presents Budget in the Lok Sabha at 11:00 AM (since 2017). Budget speech has Part A (economic review & broad policies) and Part B (tax proposals). Accompanied by documents: Estimates, Finance Bill, Appropriation Bill, Expenditure Budget, Receipts Budget, etc.</p>

            <h4>Parliamentary Discussion</h4>
            <p>General discussion (no voting), then Demands for Grants examined by Estimates Committee/Standing Committees. Lok Sabha votes on Demands for Grants. Cut motions can be moved — Policy Cut (symbolic protest), Economy Cut (reduce to specific amount), Token Cut (small sum).</p>

            <h4>Passing of Bills</h4>
            <p>After voting, Appropriation Bill authorizes withdrawal; Finance Bill enacts taxation measures. Money Bills follow special procedure (Art. 110) where Rajya Sabha's role is limited.</p>

            <h4>Implementation & Audit</h4>
            <p>Funds are released to ministries; expenditure recorded in Consolidated Fund accounts; CAG audits performance and compliance, and presents reports to the legislature for scrutiny.</p>

            <h4>Consolidated Fund of India (CFI)</h4>
            <p>All government revenues, loans raised, and receipts are credited here. Withdrawals require parliamentary authorization through Appropriation Acts. It's the primary account governing all public expenditure.</p>

            <h4>Contingency Fund of India</h4>
            <p>Set up for urgent unforeseen needs; initially used as advances by President and later regularized by Parliament's approval. Ensures immediate funds during crises without waiting for parliamentary sanction.</p>

            <h4>Public Account</h4>
            <p>Contains funds held in trust by the government (e.g., provident funds, small savings) that are repayable and do not require parliamentary appropriation to be disbursed.</p>
